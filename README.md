# PokÃ©dex Web App

## Overview
The **PokÃ©dex Web App** is an interactive web application that allows users to search for PokÃ©mon, view details about them, and browse through a carousel of PokÃ©mon images. The app fetches real-time PokÃ©mon data from the [PokÃ©API](https://pokeapi.co/) and displays the results in a visually appealing format.

## Features
- **PokÃ©mon Search**: Users can enter a PokÃ©mon name or ID and get detailed information.
- **Search Results Page**: Displays the selected PokÃ©mon in a styled card with an image and key details.
- **Smooth Image Carousel**: A dynamically transitioning carousel showcasing PokÃ©mon images with smooth animations.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
- **Sticky Footer & Navbar**: Ensures proper layout and usability.
- **Optimized Layout**: Designed to fit all content within a single screen on desktop for seamless navigation.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structuring the web pages
- **CSS3**: Styling, animations, and layout responsiveness
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**: Fetching data from the PokÃ©API, DOM manipulation, and event handling
- **Bootstrap**: Enhancing layout and responsiveness
- **PokÃ©API**: Providing real-time PokÃ©mon data

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pokedex-web-app.git
   ```
2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
   ```sh
   cd pokedex-web-app
   ```
3. **Open `index.html` in your browser**:
   - Double-click `index.html`
   - OR use a local server such as `Live Server` in VS Code

## How the JavaScript Works
The JavaScript (`script.js`) is responsible for handling user interactions, fetching data from the PokÃ©API, and updating the DOM dynamically.

### 1. Searching for a PokÃ©mon
- When the user enters a PokÃ©mon name or ID in the search bar and clicks "Search," the `searchPokemon()` function is triggered.
- It retrieves the input value and redirects the user to `search.html` with the search term as a query parameter.

### 2. Fetching and Displaying PokÃ©mon Data
- On `search.html`, JavaScript reads the query parameter from the URL.
- The `fetchPokemonData(query)` function calls the PokÃ©API (`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{query}`) to fetch data.
- If the request is successful, the `displayPokemon(pokemon)` function dynamically creates an HTML card containing:
  - The PokÃ©monâ€™s name, image, ID, and types.
  - A button linking to `details.html` (if implemented).
- If no results are found, an error message is displayed.

### 3. Image Carousel
- The homepage (`index.html`) features an image carousel.
- The carousel transitions smoothly using CSS animations.
- JavaScript ensures images rotate at a controlled interval.

### 4. Ensuring Smooth Navigation
- JavaScript ensures that the search only runs when required (i.e., no errors occur when navigating back to the homepage).
- It also makes sure that elements are only manipulated if they exist on the current page.

## File Structure
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html        # Main homepage
â”œâ”€â”€ search.html       # Search results page
â”œâ”€â”€ details.html      # PokÃ©mon details page
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css         # Main stylesheet
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js         # JavaScript logic for search & display
â”œâ”€â”€ images/           # Image assets
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md         # Project documentation
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Usage
### Searching for PokÃ©mon
1. Enter a PokÃ©mon name or ID in the search bar on the homepage.
2. Click the search button to be redirected to the search results page.
3. The app fetches and displays the PokÃ©monâ€™s details (name, ID, type, and image) in a visually appealing card.

### Browsing the Image Carousel
- The homepage features a PokÃ©mon image carousel.
- The carousel smoothly transitions between images using CSS animations.
- A semi-transparent white background enhances readability and visibility.
